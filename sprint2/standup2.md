Answer the following questions: What did you do since last standup? What are you planning/continuing to do? Any blockages?

Jason: Since last standup, I researched the possibilities of having real-time communication via websockets, I wasn't sure which framework/libary exists, until I found Spring WebSocket + STOMP. I am implementing it currently, having both live chating feature, and also storing
chat logs in the DB for chat history.
