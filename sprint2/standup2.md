Answer the following questions: What did you do since last standup? What are you planning/continuing to do? Any blockages?

Jason: Since last standup, I researched the possibilities of having real-time communication via websockets, I wasn't sure which framework/libary exists, until I found Spring WebSocket + STOMP. I am implementing it currently, having both live chating feature, and also storing
chat logs in the DB for chat history.

Ejaaj: Since the last standup, I have worked on increased functionality for the User Profile feature. I'm looking to add save features for profile edits, where they are saved onto the database. I have also reasearched the possiblity of adding security features, like TLS/SSL to protect the server from attacks.
