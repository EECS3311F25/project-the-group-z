Answer the following questions: What did you do since last standup? What are you planning/continuing to do? Any blockages?

Jason: Since last standup, I researched the possibilities of having real-time communication via websockets, I wasn't sure which framework/libary exists, until I found Spring WebSocket + STOMP. I am implementing it currently, having both live chating feature, and also storing
chat logs in the DB for chat history.

Ejaaj: Since the last standup, I have worked on increased functionality for the User Profile feature. I'm looking to add save features for profile edits, where they are saved onto the database. I have also reasearched the possiblity of adding security features, like TLS/SSL to protect the server from attacks. 

Alice: Since the last standup, I've created an Azure Document Intelligence resource and am planning to use the API to parse uploaded schedules for the upload-schedule feature. No blockages code-wise so far, but when I tried parsing a schedule in Document Intelligence Studio, the AI seemed like it might have trouble mapping some courses to their times.

David: Since the last standup, I have begun working on implementing the 'Search for Other Students' feature for our YUCircle app. I am currently working on the user interface for this feature and connecting it to the backend which will search through the database of users of our app.
