Answer the following questions: What did you do since last standup? What are you planning/continuing to do? Any blockages?

**Jason:** Last time we finished sprint 1, and I recorded the demo video, made sure everything works. Today, I am starting a new ticket, chat with other students.

**Brandon:** Last sprint, I worked on the feature to Make a Post, making sure it worked on both frontend and backend. In sprint 1 I had some difficulties in setting up the environment (downloading Node.js, PostgreSQL, etc.) , but other than that no blockages. Today, I will start building on the Make a Post feature by working on the View Post ticket.
