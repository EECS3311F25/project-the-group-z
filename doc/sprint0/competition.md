**How is our product different?**
Our product has two main qualities that differentiates it from the competition. The sense of community that comes with having a personalized app for York students and the feature for uploading your schedules. Other apps use very general features that work for mass appeal, but our app will target a single demographic: York students. The feature of uploading your schedule is also very niche to university students, which is a small portion of the population thereby making it not worth the time and resources for larger social media apps to implement.
