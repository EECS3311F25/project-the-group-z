**Project Objective**:  
YU Circle is a social media app that allows the York University students to connect with other students. Users can upload their schedules, majors, and classes onto their profile, and search for other users based on those same attributes. 


**Key Users**: 
York University Students are the target users for YU Circle. All age groups can use the app but the key users would be young adults: 18 to 25 years old. Majors in STEM disciplines would be especially targeted since those majors offer less social opportunities, making YU Circle a welcome alternative. 

Key users would also include clubs or study groups, or any kind of people who gather together. YU Circle would provide an application to view all the schedules in one place so that they can organize the optimal meeting time.

Lastly, any person who needs data regarding class enrolment and class times, such as event organizers and club managers, would be able to view statistics with percentages of students enrolled in classes, majors, or time slots.


**Key Use Cases**:
Planning group meetings, whether that be study sessions, club activities or hanging out with friends. Users can use scheduling features to create events and add friends to it. 

Using the search feature to meet new people with similar availability, classes or majors. Users can find user profiles and request to connect.

Finding the optimal time for a career fair or a club meeting. Users can use the search feature to make note of the time where most students are leaving classes.


**Key Usage Scenarios**:
*Mikhail*, an international student studying Computer Science, has just come to York University and doesn’t know anybody. He wants to make friends with students that have the same classes as him, and similar schedules so he can hang out with them outside of class. He needs a social media platform that allows him to find students that meet his conditions. 

*Stacey* is the president of the York Audiophile Club. Due to her club’s nicheness, she wants to recruit many students, specifically first years. Because of her limited man-power, she needs to pick the most opportune time for setting up her stall in Central Square. She needs a way to find out when most York students, specifically first years, don’t have class.

*Alex* and her friend *Adam* want to find friends to study with. They’re nursing students, so they would like to find other nursing students. They are busy with schoolwork so they don’t want to spend a lot of time looking for nursing students. Ideally they would place some sort of advertisement so that students can join the group on their own.


**Key Principles**:
*Serving the Community over Mass Appeal*: While other apps focus on the most inoffensive features that will serve the majority of people, we will focus on the needs of York students over everyone else.

*Security and Safety for All*: The prospect of sharing your schedule can be potentially dangerous, so privacy and security will be our top priority.

*Fostering an Inviting Community*: Features such as adding friends, as well hosting/joining events helps foster a community where people can feel comfortable meeting new people.
