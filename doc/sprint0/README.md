# YU Circle

YU Circle is a Spring Boot webapp that aims to foster social connections amongst the York University student community.

## Motivation

As Canada's 3rd-largest university, York University consists of approximately 53500 students, each with different classes and schedules. Although many resources are available to help students expand their social circles, a common problem that arises is the challenge of planning meetups when everyone has classes at different times.

Whether it be for hosting club events, organising friend meetups, planning group project meetings, or more, YU Circle allows users to identify the optimal time for meetups to take place. By sharing their course timetables, users can also identify peers with similar schedules and reach out to potential new friends.
