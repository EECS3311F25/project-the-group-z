Our team (group AU) worked on sprint 0 in a collaborative manner. Each team member was assigned specific parts of sprint 0 (e.g personas.md to one person, readme.md to another), and after the completion of an artifact, it was approved by all team members before it be pushed to Github. The only tool used was discord, where we pinned a list of items that needed to be completed in our group chat, and once it was completed, we crossed it off as complete. Our team made decisions based on the comfort level, preference, and experience each team member had with certain aspects of software development. Story points in our product backlog was based on the complexity of a story, (i.e how many components are required in our MVC to be adjusted/added for this story, how much technical knowledge is required for one to complete the story). We played planning poker and on average had 1 vote for each story, and if someone didnâ€™t agree with the majority, we would try to explain to one another our reasoning, for choosing this amount of story points, and refine from there. We met around twice a week to organize and set everything up. Lessons we learned were to always be communicative, and make sure not to leave things until the very end, because sometimes we realize that we might be missing something, or something might need refinement which could take some time.
