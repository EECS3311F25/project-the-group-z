Answer the following questions: What did you do since last standup? What are you planning/continuing to do? Any blockages?

Jason: Since last standup, I finished the live chat using websockets and STOMP. However, there is a blocker, I need the story of viewing posts to be finished first, otherwise I wouldn't know who to message. Right now, you can chat with a fixed user in my database, however it does not save (messages) to db for now.

Brandon: Since last standup, I have been testing the features i have implemented in terms of liking and commenting on a user's own posts (QA testing these features from both frontend and backend), and so far and unable to find any bugs. I will continue to test for errors and prepare for the demo of this feature for sprint2.
