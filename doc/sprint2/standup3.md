Answer the following questions: What did you do since last standup? What are you planning/continuing to do? Any blockages?

Jason: Since last standup, I finished the live chat using websockets and STOMP. However, there is a blocker, I need the story of viewing posts to be finished first, otherwise I wouldn't know who to message. Right now, you can chat with a fixed user in my database, however it does not save (messages) to db for now.
